# Jax Algorithms
## Common machine learning algorithms implemented in Jax

1. Linear Regression (California housing dataset)
2. Logistic Regression (Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer)
3. MLP (MNIST)
4. 

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open any of the notebook files to explore the implementations.
